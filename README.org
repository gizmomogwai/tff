* tff - Toggle friend file
** Introduction
Toggles between your friend files.
** Customization
tff is fully customizeable with emacs customize system. see
customize-group tff.

Best way to customize on a pre project basis is to use
.dir-locals.el.
If you happen to work in a project with .hpp files right next to .cpp
files you could customize tff as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(
 (nil . (
         (tff/patterns-and-replacements . (("\\(.*\\)\\.hpp" "\\1.cpp") ("\\(.*\\)\\.hpp" "\\1.cpp")))
         )
      )
 )
#+END_SRC
