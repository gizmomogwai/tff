* tff - Toggle friend file
** Introduction
Toggles between your friend files.
With this package it is very easy to navigate between correlated
files.

** Customization
tff is fully customizable with Emacs customize system. see
customize-group tff.

Best way to customize on a per project basis is to use
.dir-locals.el.
If you happen to work in a project with a setup like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC
.
├── module.cpp
├── module.hpp
└── module_test.cpp
#+END_SRC
that means h files side by side with implementation and tests you
could customize tff as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(
  (nil . ; all modes
    (
      (tff/patterns-and-replacements . ; our variable
        (
          ; pairs of regexps and replacements
          ; replacements can reference groups
          ("\\(.*\\)_test\\.cpp" "\\1.hpp") ; converts module_test.cpp -> module.hpp
          ("\\(.*\\)\\.hpp" "\\1.cpp") ; converts module.hpp -> module.cpp
          ("\\(.*\\)\\.cpp" "\\1_test.cpp") ; converts module.cpp -> module_test.cpp
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
#+END_SRC
